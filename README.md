# tailtop

A terminal UI for Tailscale — *htop for your tailnet.*

`tailtop` is a second front-end to the `tailscaled` daemon already running on
your machine (the same daemon the official GUI uses). It installs nothing on
the Tailscale side, needs no root, and runs entirely in your terminal.

## Modes

`Tab` cycles between three modes, each tuned to one intent:

| Mode | Intent | View | Theme |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| **Comfort** | manage | List (GUI parity) | Studio |
| **Cockpit** | operate | Live cards + sparklines | Mission Control |
| **Observatory** | observe | Network topology | Brutalist |

## Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | cycle modes (Comfort → Cockpit → Observatory) |
| `j` / `k` / `↑` / `↓` | navigate devices |
| `⌘P` / `Ctrl+P` | command palette (all verbs for the selected device) |
| `p` | ping · `c` copy IP · `w` whois · `n` netcheck |
| `e` | toggle exit node · `f` send file · `s` SSH |
| `r` | refresh · `?` help · `q` quit |

Mutating actions (exit node, funnel, send) confirm first. SSH suspends the
TUI, hands the terminal to `tailscale ssh`, and resumes on exit.

## Requirements

- The `tailscale` CLI on your `PATH` (the daemon must be running).
- Python ≥ 3.13.

## Run

```sh
uv run tailtop
```

## Develop

```sh
uv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv run pytest
```
